# A variable is a named storage location for acomputer program,

# it can hold differebt values of different data types

# Trial Questions

// 1. Create variable name (firstFavNumb) & store your favorite number.
// 2. Create variable name (secondFavNumb) & store second fav Number.
// 3. Check (firstFavNumb is greater then secondFavNumb)
// 4. Check (firstFavNumb is less then secondFavNumb)
// 5. Check (firstFavNumb is greater then & equal to secondFavNumb)
// 6. Check (firstFavNumb is less then & equal to secondFavNumb)
// 7. Check (firstFavNumb is equal to secondFavNumb) using strict equality operator.
// 8. Check (firstFavNumb is equal to secondFavNumb) using loose equality operator.
// 9. Check (firstFavNumb is not equal to secondFavNumb) using strict non-equality operator.
// 10. Check is (firstFavNumb is not equal to secondFavNumb) using loose non-equality operator.
==============================================================================================

// 1. Create Variable name (isJsProgrammingLanguage) & store true as a value.
// 2. Create variable name (isJsHard) & store false as a value.
// 3. Create variable name (favNumb) & store your favorite number inside.
// 4. Now Add favNumber with the value of undefined.=========================================================================================
